#Notes
##SOLID Principles
* **Single responsibility principle**
    * Every class should have a single responsibility
    * Split a class in smaller classes
    * Avoid god classes
    * No more than a screen of code per. class
    
* **Open close principle**
    * Your classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
    * Private variables and fields. Expose only when you need to
    * Use abstract classes

* **Liskov substitution principle**
    * Objects of the program would be replaceable with an instance of their subtypes
    * Violations will often fail the *Is a* test
    
* **Interface segregation principles**
    * Make fine-grained interfaces that are client specific
    * Minimise the interactions between them
    * Avoid god interfaces
    
* **Dependency inversion principles**
    * Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions
